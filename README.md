Open Blocks is a free fork of Blocks by Google, An app designed to make creating 3D models fun, easy, and accessible. We are in the process of making large number of changes. Please check our progress and our roadmap on our [docs site](https://docs.openblocks.app).

We hope to maintain and improve upon Blocks as a community-led project, free forever!

As the original repo is archived we cannot submit PRs, so feel free to submit them here!

## Downloads
### Stores

### GitHub
- [Formal GitHub Releases](https://github.com/icosa-foundation/open-blocks/releases/latest)

Note that despite a Windows build, it does work on Linux. For example one can add as a non-Steam game to their library, force compatibility with Proton experimental and run Open Blocks as-is, without any modification.
